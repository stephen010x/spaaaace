# Spaaaace Game Demo

This demo, written using p5.js and JavaScript, demonstrates a top-down pseudo-3D space traveling game, and how one might create a 2D-like space game while also being able to see distant planetary bodies with a static camera, by implementing a Z-axis that is controlled by the player's distance from planets, allowing them to see multiple destinations of travel without the need for a map.

## Origins
Originally, the classic version of this demo was made years ago on [Khan Academy's](https://www.khanacademy.org/) ProcessingJS editor. The editor which can be found [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/pjs). but as the project started to increase in scope, the need for file organization arose, and I eventually transitioned the project to p5.js, and GitHub Pages.
